      <description>My name is Gyuri. This is my blog where I write about technology, among other things.
I worked in several startups, some of which have been acquired or IPO&amp;rsquo;ed.
I created a photo app, which you can checkout if you have an iPhone.
Currently I am a cofounder of MARS, developing self-driving technology.
I studied Computer Science at KAIST.
